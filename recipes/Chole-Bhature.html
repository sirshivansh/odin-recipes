    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried bread (bhature). The chickpea curry is made with a blend of aromatic spices, tomatoes, and onions, while the bhature is made from all-purpose flour and yogurt, resulting in a soft and fluffy texture. This dish is often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or lunch and is typically accompanied by pickles, onions, and yogurt.</p>
